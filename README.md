This is a competitive programming template mainly used for ICPC competitions. Currently, it basically contains all mainstream knowledge points. 

I've been an amateur in competitive programming since 2019.

The whole code can be viewed in dot cpp in different classifications. And the lite version of the pdf, which I think it will be used in the ICPC is "cp_template.pdf". 

If you have any questions, you can send the issue.
